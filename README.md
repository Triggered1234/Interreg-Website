Welcome to the website that I created for a school project calleed Creativity Without Frontiers!

This is my very first project, and while it may not be much, both at that time and in present I'm still proud of the work I did.

The website contains various functions such as a register/login system with confirmation e-mails, administrator-based posting of articles, files and images of all types.
While I did code most of the styling for the website, I also used bootstraps for things such as the navigation bar. 

Languages used for building this project are:PhP,HTML,CSS,SQL and JavaScript.
